It also successfully flagged all of those with symptons that were detected by human doctors."

The article stressed the importance of both the quantity of the training data as well as its diversity, which corresponds well with what we have learned. The precise method used was not mentioned by the article, but it is clear that a form of machine learning (probably supervised machine learning) was used. And machine learning is a subfield of data science."
